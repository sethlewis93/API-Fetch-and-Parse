## About

### Exceeds
At styles.css file I updated lines 35 and 36 as follows:
Change color and weight of the header text to help it "pop" a little more.

Inside scripts.js file at the generateUserHTML function, I changed color of the directory emails to green to help them stand out as if they were a link that someone could click to email directly. 

#### To-do

photos poor quality
prettier not working
